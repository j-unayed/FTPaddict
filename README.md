**Important!** 
- **Donâ€™t delete** the `_internal` folder or any content from the folder. The program will crash if you do so!

- The first time you run `FTPaddict.exe`, Windows Defender might flag it as malware because it was converted from `.py` to `.exe` using `pyinstaller`. Click `Run Anyway` or add an exception from your security settings.
